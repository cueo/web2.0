XHR Level 2
    Latest version
    Can create a form on the fly (refer code)

If we have a bulky form, there is a possibility of the entire submission failing
    Instead, we might want to upload logical segments of the form in parts
        Eg. Address, CV, Card details

Usually, POST is not "idempotent" - same response every time it is called

For <input type="file">, you can have an attribute multiple which is used to control if single/multiple files can be uploaded
For multiple, you refer it as domElement.files[index] to get each different file

In php.ini
    Must set
        file_uploads = On
        upload_max_filesize = 2M
        max_file_uploads = 20

At the server side, $_FILES will have all the files that have been uploaded
    $_FILES['OurFileName']
        This will have the metadata
            filename
            actual file

Bootstrap & Jquery:

Imagine you have to make an element fade out.
    Using opacity property and some js, you can do it
        But this is tedious :(
        Shifts focus from product to irrelevant stuff

jquery
    fast & easy

Certain frameworks are available to provide an interface for animations and front end features
    Eg. Bootstrap made by Twitter developers

Bootstrap has
    css - concerned with styling, contains properties for each element/class
    js  - has jquery code (hence must add dependency)

Bootstrap gives us
    Consistency across browsers
    Open source - can contribute, modify
    Mobile first!
        Design assuming mobile device
        Then we can add to support more sizes

Responsive Design
    Depends on screen size
        xs(< 768px), sm(768px - 990px), md(990px - 1200px), lg(> 1200px)

Body onload
    NOT A GOOD EVENT
    WAITS FOR EVERYTHING to get completely loaded!
        Even videos and images :O

We could atleast wait for the DOM to be ready
    document.readyState
        interactive
        complete
            jquery waits for this

jquery instructions have two parts:
    selection.action

Selection rules are same as css
