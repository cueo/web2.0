Eg. BBC
    If we want to retrieve information from it, we will get it in the form of HTML.
    But there will be lot of unnecessary styling information
    For their popularity, they would like to send info to others in a convenient format
    XML suits this well as the tags can be handled easily without much work (had we used JSON)
        Plus styling is also easy (XSL)
    So they can provide a feed - in a single standard format

At around this time, Microsoft introduced CDF (Channel Description Framework)
Over time, the format became too tedious and it was prone to mistakes and readers started failing

Netscape - started
    RSS - RDF Site Summary
    Resource Description Framework
    Dropped it

Harvard took over
    Really Simple Syndication

How does the person visiting the HTML page know that there is an XML version as well?
    <link rel="alternate" href="">
    AND
    RSS version image - .â•—

Browser can bookmark it
    And usually has a mechanism to auto fetch latest content

RSS
    Root node is <rss>
    <rss>
        <channel>
            <ttl>X</ttl> <!-- Minutes -->
            <item> for each headline
                <title>
                <link>
                <description>

Atom(supported by Google) or #### feed

Problem Statement:
    Scrolling news ticker
    With hyperlinks
    If we move mouse over it, stop scrolling
    Use AJAX

-----

All functions have a property called prototype that typically point to some object

obj = new foo();
obj inherits from the object pointed to by foo.prototype
