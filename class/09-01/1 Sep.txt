XParser is an Atom and RSS parser

xparser = ####

xparser.getFeed(sUrl, fpCallBack[, oCallBackScope]);
    URL of the remote feed to be parsed
    Once it is loaded, the call back function is called
    Entire XML is JSONified and passed as param to fpCallBack

for(var i = 0, obj; obj = array[i]; ++i) {
    ;
}
