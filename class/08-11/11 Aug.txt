No history maintained if we use XHR! :(

But Gmail maintains history by using different URLs
How?
    window
        .document
        .location
        .history!

When we do a back or a forward on the window, it fires an event popstate
Register a handler, window.onpopstate = handler
    In the handler, use event.state to get the saved object

And save state using,
    window.history.pushState(objToBePushed, labelToEntry, url);
