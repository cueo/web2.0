RSS vs Atom:
	Major differences:
	   Frozen:
			RSS specification is frozen, no significant changes can be made
			ATOM is under IETF license, can issue further dev (However nobody
			  wants to, but I guess that's another issue)
	   Protocols:
			RSS has 2 major protocols, blogger and metaweblog. Known issues
			  of inter compatibility are present
			Atom has a unified protocol Atom publishing protocol
	   Payload:
			RSS payload maybe any format (unspecified), could be text or html
			  anything. We can't tell
			Atom requires you to enclose it in a tag specifying the type.
			  (You will never attempt inappropriate parse)
	   Content:
			RSS channel is required to have link, title, description while
			  Item need not even
			ATOM requires both to have and an additional timestamp and a
			  unique identifier
	   Autodiscovery:
			The application/rss+xml is not even a standard
			while application/atom+xml is a standard (Also has self subscribe)
 Minor:
	   Language:
			RSS has language tag
			ATOM uses xml:lang
	  Categories:
			RSS has label and domain
			Atom also has those + one more for humans
