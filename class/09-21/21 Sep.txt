Chat messenger (Server based)
	Uses websockets
	Polling (bad)
		Even with exponential fallback
			16s -> 32s
			What if the dude types at 17s

Instead, let's make a request and let the server respond to it later
	"When someone types, let me know"
	Server may use long poll
		\
		 -->
		 -->
		 -->
		 --><--
		/
	Send and close it

	Hi
		\
		/	Sup
		/	Man
		/	How're
		/	You?
		close
