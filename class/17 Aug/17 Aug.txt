XML vs JSON

JSON:
    moive:
    {
        key1: value1,
        key2: value2
    }
XML:
    <movie>
        <key1>value1</key1>
        <key2>value2</key2>
    </movie>
    Length of childNodes = 2 when newlines are discounted

Types of nodes in XML:
    Total = 9
    Common = 4
        element, text, attribute #####

childNodes[]
    Does not include attribute nodes

// Using XML instead of JSON
In updateDetails()
    Since we are returning XML
    this.responseXML    -> null
    this.responseText   -> XML stuff as text

Too much parsing required.

Instead,
    Use Content-type: text/XML
        responseXML will have object.XMLDocument

    root = this.responseXML;
    root.childNodes.length is 1 (Why?)
    root.childNodes[0].childNodes[2].firstChild.nodeValue is 2005

    If we do,
        root = this.responseXML.documentElement
        This is the correct way and We can skip childNodes[0]

    // getElementById can also be used
    root.getElementsByTagName("lead").firstChild.nodeValue is SRK

this.xhr.onerror = this.handleError;

handleError()
    alert()

Security:
    If not opened on localhost, XHR will give error because it is trying to make cross domain requests (localhost and file://)

CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing
    A protected way of cross domain requests
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods

Simple Request
    GET, POST (text/plain, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, ##multipart form data)
Non-simple Request
    POST(json, xml etc), PUT, DELETE

For simple requests
    Adds a field 'Origin' into the header - value = IP of the requesting machine
    W3 Requirement
        Browsers responsibility to block Cross Domain Origin calls

Any request which has a customized header field set by code (setRequestHeader), that request automatically becomes non simple

For non-simple
    Preflighted request
        First, a request with method 'OPTIONS' is made
        In the header field, send Access-Control-Request-Method(s) for POST or others
        Server should
            Check the allowed origins & then check the allowed methods
            Respond with two fields

        If successful, then my next request will be a POST
