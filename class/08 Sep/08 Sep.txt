bootstrap has both css and js(jquery) components

For the js component, must include the jquery.js first! (dependency)

<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost/bootstrap-3.3.7-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
<script src="http://localhost/jquery-2.2.4.js"> </script> <!-- Must come before bootstrap.min.js because it is a dependency -->
<script src="http://localhost/bootstrap-3.3.7-dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"> </script>

Bootstrap internally divides the screen into 12 columns

class col-xs-6
    For all devices having xs or MORE
    Give this 6 columns

class container
    Keep the width of the element FIXED TILL the size of the screen is within a given range

class container-fluid
    Continuously keep the width equal to the screen size ( / window size)
