session_start()
	Make sure you do this if you want to use

Servlets
	Will be a problem if we have 200 servlet threads on while loop (eg chat application)

Solution
	Asynchronous servlets

Web Services
	Services "obtainable" on the web
		Why not do it yourself?
			Re-inventing the wheel
			Faster product development
			Cross Platform access

Website | Web App | Web Service

Websites usually serve static pages
Web app has some kind of intelligence that differentiates the client
Web service typically not used by humans. Used by some piece of software
	Never returns markup. Either xml, json or both

Client usually never hits the services. They usually ask the server which may use the services

API
	Human readable well designed URL

REST-ful (REpresentational State Transfer)
	http as a client protocol
	xml/json returned (no markup)
		try to provide both. If not, then json pls
	set of URLs to access the services
	discoverable
	self describing
	CRUD operations
		Create POST
		Read GET
		Update PUT
		Delete DELETE

Architectural model
	Resources
		eg. Image
	Representation
		eg. JPEG
	Connectors
		eg. ####

List of criteria:
	Must have communication split across server and client
	Stateless
	All responses must be cacheable
	Server architecture must be layered
	All components in the system must provide a uniform interface

	29th September
	This day will be remembered

The state of the resource is transferred to the client side
Connectors connect representation and resource

URI = URN + URL
(Well approximately :p)

http://localhost/usn.html#three
	Location is http://localhost/usn.html
	Resource is three

APIs

Question:
	Given a USN, then provide some information

	http://server/userinfo.php?usn=9
		This is bad cuz the guy will know that we are using php
	Let's hide that and just provide a common interface

	http://server/userinfo/usn/9

Notes on Configuration:

	httpd.conf
		Uncomment the following line
			LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

	Most of the config is global
		If we want to change it at a directory level
			Move the configuration into the different directories
			Then they will be called .htaccess

	Before we write rules, we must ask apache if we can override the normal rule
		Look for <Directory "c:/Apache24/htdocs">
		    Change
				AllowOverride None
				to
				AllowOverride All
