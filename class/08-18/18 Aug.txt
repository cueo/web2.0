Why use XHR to stream videos when we already have video tag?
    We can control how much of the video should be loaded and load more based on some event

Note:
    The starting part of the video will have the meta data
    Hence, first few seconds preview is fine
        But from the middle, we won't be able to interpret the data

If we stream by repeatedly doing sleep & echo,
    readyState will be 3! (partial data loaded)

Patterns:

Problem patterns and solution patterns


x   Validation
    Scrolling - horizontal and vertical
        Lot of data has come. Should it have come or not?
    Partial Loading
x   Responsive Design
        Abnormal behaviour on smaller screens
    Less interaction
        Automatic instead of manual data fetch
    Loading time
        Ideally < 100ms
    Pop Ups
        Must avoid
    Ads
        Should not avoid (cuz we want $$ :p )
    Relevant Data & Not too much
        Combine this with partial loading & loading time

? Multistage download vs Infinite Scrolling

Guidelines for Load order
    Text early
        If LOT of text, then look at the scroll pattern and make the browser send a signal to the server to send more data.
        Predictive Fetch + Pagination
    Videos - don't even load?
    Ads should not come last :O
        Somewhere in the middle

Periodic Refresh
    Bad if we do too many calls
    Make it better using Exponential Backoff! B)
        Retry after 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s etc

Early send
    Eg. search suggestions
        When to fetch?
            Min char
            Pause
            Submission Throttle

Problem statement:
    Have a huge text file.
    Load the first page and show the user
    If he scrolls more than 350px, load the next page
    This goes on till the end of the file
