Part 1:
------

    Asynchronous calls examples:
        XHR
        Hidden frames
        img loading (say we want to obtain a boolean result)
            onload & onerror (via status code)
            return differently sized images based on what happens
                eg. 1x1 or 1x2
                onblur, create an image dynamically and make request
                point the src to a php script
                body will have the image
                    if we want to return a string, add it within the <head> tag - maybe as a cookie
            * We can make cross domain calls! (unlike frames)
            -ves:
                If we want to return strings as cookies, we have a restriction on the size as very little data will fit within the header
                Won't work if images are disabled (or cookies if we are using them)
                History can't be maintained

    PHP GD configuration
        Go to php_directory/ext/
        Look for a file called php_gd2.dll
        If present,
            Go to php.ini
            Look for the line and uncomment it
                ;extension=php_gd2.dll -> extension=php_gd2.dll

Part 2:
------

XHR -> XMLHttpRequest
    readyState          -> 0 to 4
        0 - Uninitialized.
        1 - Loading (the open() method has been called)
        2 - Loaded (request has been sent)
        3 - response partially arrived.
        4 - Completed (data has completely arrived and the connection has been closed)
    status              -> 200, 400, 500 etc
    onreadystatechange  ->

    responseText
    responseXML
    response        (binary data)

Create the XHR object
Register function (onreadystatechange)
If POST,
    setRequestHeader("application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
open("METHOD", url, async(true/false))  (readyState=1)
    Only allows asynchronous requests

--

The keyword "this" will refer to the caller
    Refers to obj in getDetails function
    Refers to obj.xhr in updateDetails function
