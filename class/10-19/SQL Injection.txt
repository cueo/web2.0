Look at index.html and book.php

mysqli_query is good because it allows only ONE query
	STILL can be exploited

DO NOT SHOW ERRORS TO THE USER!
	mysqli_error()
	Ok during development
	REMOVED in the production version

SANITIZE inputs
	Better to tell the user that the format is invalid

Don't run queries as privileged user
	eg. root

MySQL
	All meta data stored in information_schema
