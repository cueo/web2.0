401
	If a resource is restricted
	Authentication required
		Server can have some config files
		Set up permissions in advance

	Browser will automatically pop up a dialog
		Username and password
	Second request
		In the header field called Authorization,
			user and password are sent
			user:password -> base64 encoded
		Server will know this, decode the base64 encoded
			Will unpack, and check the config files

Authentication
	BASIC
		base64
	DIGEST
		Little more complicated
		Will be done later on

open the .htaccess file in the folder which is to have restricted access

	AuthType BASIC
	AuthName "CONFIDENTIAL INFO"
		this is shown in the prompt window
	AuthUserFile "some_path/apache/bin/pwd"
		location of the file
	Require valid-user

Create the password file using
	htpasswd.exe or htdigest.exe

	htpasswd.exe -c pwd guest
	guest123, say

	pwd
		guest:asker23yroisf23r0qoje2

Once the username is valid, the browser caches the username and password and will include it in the subsequent requests' headers
The moment the server sends a 401, the cache is cleaned

How to tackle this?
	Can the server do something about this?
