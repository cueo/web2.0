Front end pure bootstrap
Backend with ajax and django

Start on the bootstrap for them blueprints
Since you haven't used bootstrap before I recommend looking at some tutorials
Because there's a web interface as well as a Python interface
The thing with a django project is that the front end and back end are not mutually exclusive
They're closely integrated
With php you can just make get and post calls from the front end
But with django you can also do that
But there are better ways
