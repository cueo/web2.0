Twitter Bootstrap: (V3)

1) A powerful Client-side (Front-end Framework) 
  - makes Web Development faster and easier. Powerful features.
2) Uses HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
3) Mobile-first approach
4) Emphasis on Responsive-Web Design (Apps/sites that automatically adjust themselves
   to look good on all kinds of devices)
5) Compatible with all browsers.
6) Open Source and hence, 
7) Customizable
8) Bootstrap can be applied in two ways - a) Using only CSS styles (by employing
   the "class" attributes on elements). b) Using Javascript. This uses JQuery.

Bootstrap was released in 2011 by Twitter

Four classes used for responsive web design (Grids) - 
xs - Extremely small ( mobile devices)
sm - Small (tablets)
md - Medium (laptops/ small desktops)
lg - Large Desktops

Widths < 768px -> xs
between 768 px and 990 px -> small
Between 990 and 1200px -> medium
Greater than 1200 px -> large

In a GRID system, each row is split into 12 columns
Gutter width is typically 30px (15px on either side of the column. This is analogous
to the cell-padding attribute in <table>)

Fixed vs Fluid Layouts - The "container" class and the "container-fluid" class are used.
The Fluid layout stretches to meet the width of the device, 
whereas the "Fixed layout" has a fixed width for each of the different screen sizes.
(That is, for instance the layout width could be fixed at 1100px for any device whose 
width is between 1150 and  1300px)
	 
The Grid System:
Grid Sizes: < 768px, between 768 and 990, between 990 and 1200. Greater than 1200
The classes used are:
 : col-xs-*
 : col-sm-*
 : col-md-*
 : col-lg-*
 
 The screen is split into 12 columns. How many columns you want to span with the 
 element is upto you. The addition must total 12 though. 
 Otherwise behaviour is unexpected. Gutter width is 15 px on either side of the column.
 
 For instance, if you want two divs to span the entire 12 columns for small devices,
 you can use <div class="col-sm-6"> for both divs. Thus each div will span 6 columns
 in this case for all devices which are small or bigger (medium and large too)
