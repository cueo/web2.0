REVERSE AJAX:
Need for Reverse AJAX - typical use cases.
Http Streaming vs Long Poll, timing diagrams.
COMET  - using Hidden Frames - the need for heartbeat() function here.
       - using XHR (the use of readyState == 3)
	   - using server-sent events (SSE).
	   - The advantages of using SSEs.
	   - The problem with simultaneous requests (http 1.1 restriction)due to COMET calls.
	   
AJAX - PERFORMANCE:  
The "2 simultaneous requests only" limitation with http 1.1.
The reason for the limitation.
Impact on performance on client and server sides - possible workarounds
  - Maintaining priority Queues, 
  - increasing connections at browser end
  - using sub-domains.
  - using separate servers with Access-control headers.
  - packing requests into one.

Status code 200 does not mean all is ok. why??
Race conditions on the server.
Use of the "HEAD" call.
Use of Compression techniques. TTFB, TTLB. Minimising TTFB.
Caching: The use of Cache-control and Expires headers. Difference between the two.
GET vs POST requests to save performance.

Minifying code. 
Using external Javascripts.
